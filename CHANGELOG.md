## v1.0.0 - 2025-09-22

We are excited to launch v1.0.0 of this package!

This version is based on the final release of [ryangjchandler/filament-navigation](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/filament-navigation), which was discontinued on August 25th, 2025. We have forked the project to keep it alive and have made some improvements and cleanups while staying close to the original.

A big thank you to [@ryangjchandler](https://github.com/ryangjchandler) for creating and maintaining the package up to this point!

> [!NOTE]
This version is compatible with Filament v3 and below. Looking for Filament v4 support? We will be releasing v2 shortly, which supports Filament v4+.
